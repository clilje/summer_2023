	abstract = {Mid-infrared observations are powerful in identifying heavily obscured Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) which have weak emission in other wavelengths. Data from the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) onboard JWST provides an excellent opportunity to perform such studies. We take advantage of the MIRI imaging data from the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science Survey (CEERS) to investigate the AGN population in the distant universe. We estimate the source properties of MIRI-selected objects by utilizing spectral energy distribution (SED) modelling, and classify them into star-forming galaxies (SF), SF-AGN mixed objects, and AGN. The source numbers of these types are 418, 111, and 31, respectively, from 4 MIRI pointings covering \${\textbackslash}sim 9\$ arcmin\${\textasciicircum}2\$. The sample spans a redshift range of \${\textbackslash}approx 0\$--5. We derive the median SEDs for all three source types, respectively, and publicly release them. The median MIRI SED of AGN is similar to the typical SEDs of hot dust-obscured galaxies and Seyfert 2s, for which the mid-IR SEDs are dominantly from AGN-heated hot dust. Based on our SED-fit results, we estimate the black-hole accretion density (BHAD; i.e., total BH growth rate per comoving volume) as a function of redshift. At \$z{\textless}3\$, the resulting BHAD agrees with the X-ray measurements in general. At \$z{\textgreater}3\$, we identify a total of 27 AGN and SF-AGN mixed objects, leading to that our high-\$z\$ BHAD is substantially higher than the X-ray results (\${\textbackslash}sim 0.5\$ dex at \$z {\textbackslash}approx 3\$--5). This difference indicates MIRI can identify a large population of heavily obscured AGN missed by X-ray surveys at high redshifts.},

	abstract = {We present a new model of the nebular emission from star-forming galaxies in a wide range of chemical compositions, appropriate to interpret observations of galaxies at all cosmic epochs. The model relies on the combination of state-of-the-art stellar population synthesis and photoionization codes to describe the ensemble of HII regions and the diffuse gas ionized by young stars in a galaxy. A main feature of this model is the self-consistent yet versatile treatment of element abundances and depletion onto dust grains, which allows one to relate the observed nebular emission from a galaxy to both gas-phase and dust-phase metal enrichment. We show that this model can account for the rest-frame ultraviolet and optical emission-line properties of galaxies at different redshifts and find that ultraviolet emission lines are more sensitive than optical ones to parameters such as C/O abundance ratio, hydrogen gas density, dust-to-metal mass ratio and upper cutoff of the stellar initial mass function. We also find that, for gas-phase metallicities around solar to slightly sub-solar, widely used formulae to constrain oxygen ionic fractions and the C/O ratio from ultraviolet and optical emission-line luminosities are reasonable faithful. However, the recipes break down at non-solar metallicities, making them inappropriate to study chemically young galaxies. In such cases, a fully self-consistent model of the kind presented in this paper is required to interpret the observed nebular emission.},

Most of our synthetic images were created with the SKIRT radiative transfer code, including the effects of dust attenuation and scattering, and performing the radiative transfer directly on the Voronoi mesh used by the simulations themselves. We have analysed both our synthetic and real Pan-STARRS images with the newly developed \${\textbackslash}tt\{statmorph\}\$ code, which calculates non-parametric morphological diagnostics -- including the Gini-\$M\_\{20\}\$ and concentration-asymmetry-smoothness (CAS) statistics -- and performs two-dimensional S{\textbackslash}'ersic fits. Overall, we find that the optical morphologies of IllustrisTNG galaxies are in good agreement with observations, and represent a substantial improvement compared to the original Illustris simulation. In particular, the locus of the Gini-\$M\_\{20\}\$ diagram is consistent with that inferred from observations, while the median trends with stellar mass of all the morphological, size and shape parameters considered in this work lie within the \${\textbackslash}sim\$1\${\textbackslash}sigma\$ scatter of the observational trends. However, the IllustrisTNG model has some difficulty with more stringent tests, such as producing a strong morphology-colour relation. This results in a somewhat higher fraction of red discs and blue spheroids compared to observations. Similarly, the morphology-size relation is problematic: while observations show that discs tend to be larger than spheroids at a fixed stellar mass, such a trend is not present in IllustrisTNG.},

Measurements of key galaxy properties, such as star formation rate and metallicity, through these observations will provide unique insight into, e.g., the role of feedback from stars and active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in regulating galaxy evolution, the co-evolution of AGNs and host galaxies, the physical origin of the 'main sequence' of star-forming galaxies and the contribution by star-forming galaxies to cosmic reionization. We present an original framework to simulate and analyse observations performed with the Near Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) on board JWST. We use the BEAGLE tool (BayEsian Analysis of GaLaxy sEds) to build a semi-empirical catalogue of galaxy spectra based on photometric spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of dropout galaxies in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF). We demonstrate that the resulting catalogue of galaxy spectra satisfies different types of observational constraints on high redshift galaxies, and use it as input to simulate NIRSpec/prism (R{\textasciitilde}100) observations. We show that a single 'deep' ({\textasciitilde}100 ks) NIRSpec/prism pointing in the HUDF will enable S/N{\textgreater}3 detections of multiple optical emission lines in {\textasciitilde}30 ({\textasciitilde}60) galaxies at z{\textgreater}6 (z{\textasciitilde}4-6) down to m\_F160W{\textless}30 AB mag.

Despite extensive efforts, however, the quasar ULAS J1120+0641 at z=7.09 has remained the only one known at z{\textgreater}7 for more than half a decade. Here we report observations of the quasar ULAS J134208.10+092838.61 (hereafter J1342+0928) at redshift z=7.54. This quasar has a bolometric luminosity of 4e13 times the luminosity of the Sun and a black hole mass of 8e8 solar masses. The existence of this supermassive black hole when the Universe was only 690 million years old---just five percent of its current age---reinforces models of early black-hole growth that allow black holes with initial masses of more than about 1e4 solar masses or episodic hyper-Eddington accretion. We see strong evidence of absorption of the spectrum of the quasar redwards of the Lyman alpha emission line (the Gunn-Peterson damping wing), as would be expected if a significant amount (more than 10 per cent) of the hydrogen in the intergalactic medium surrounding J1342+0928 is neutral. We derive a significant fraction of neutral hydrogen, although the exact fraction depends on the modelling. However, even in our most conservative analysis we find a fraction of more than 0.33 (0.11) at 68 per cent (95 per cent) probability, indicating that we are probing well within the reionization epoch of the Universe.},

	abstract = {(Abridged) Narrow Line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) galaxies have low mass black holes and mass accretion rates close to (or exceeding) Eddington, so a standard blackbody accretion disc should peak in the EUV. However, the lack of true absorption opacity in the disc means that the emission is better approximated by a colour temperature corrected blackbody, and this colour temperature correction is large enough (\${\textbackslash}sim 2.4\$) that the bare disc emission from a zero spin black hole can extend into the soft X-ray bandpass. Part of the soft X-ray excess seen in these objects must be intrinsic emission from the disc unless the vertical structure is very different to that predicted. However, the soft excess is much broader than predicted by a bare disc spectrum, indicating some Compton upscattering by cool, optically thick material. We associate this with the disc itself, so it must ultimately be powered by mass accretion. We build an energetically self consistent model assuming that the emission thermalises at large radii, but that at smaller radii the gravitational energy is split between powering optically thick Comptonised disc emission (forming the soft X-ray excess) and an optically thin corona above the disc (forming the tail to higher energies). We show examples of this model fit to the extreme NLS1 REJ1034+396, and to the much lower Eddington fraction Broad Line Seyfert 1 PG1048+231. We use these to guide our fits and interpretations of three template spectra made from co-adding multiple sources to track out a sequence of AGN spectra as a function of \$L/L\_\{Edd\}\$.

We detect 42 out of 49 targets with a 0.5-2 keV X-ray luminosity 10{\textasciicircum}41-10{\textasciicircum}43 erg/s. We perform spectral fitting for the 10 objects with enough counts ({\textgreater}200), and they are all well fit by a simple power-law model modified by Galactic absorption, with no sign of significant intrinsic absorption. While we cannot fit the X-ray spectral slope directly for the rest of the sample, we estimate it from the hardness ratio and find a range of photon indices consistent with those seen in more luminous and massive objects. The X-ray-to-optical spectral slope (alphaox) of our IMBH sample is systematically flatter than in active galaxies with more massive black holes, consistent with the well-known correlation between alphaox and UV luminosity. Thanks to the wide dynamic range of our sample, we find evidence that alphaox increases with decreasing M\_BH as expected from accretion disk models, where the UV emission systematically decreases as M\_BH decreases and the disk temperature increases. We also find a long tail toward low alphaox values. While some of these sources may be obscured, given the high L\_bol/L\_Eddington values in the sample, we argue that some may be intrinsically X-ray-weak, perhaps owing to a rare state that radiates very little coronal emission.},

The new model \{{\textbackslash}sc oxaf\} reproduces the diversity of spectral shapes that arise in physically-based models. We identify and explain degeneracies in the effects of AGN parameters on model spectral shapes, with a focus on the complete degeneracy between the black hole mass and AGN luminosity. Our re-parametrized model \{{\textbackslash}sc oxaf\} removes these degeneracies and accepts three parameters which directly describe the output spectral shape: the energy of the peak of the accretion disk emission \$E\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{peak\}\$, the photon power-law index of the non-thermal emission \${\textbackslash}Gamma\$, and the proportion of the total flux which is emitted in the non-thermal component \$p\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{NT\}\$. The parameter \$E\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{peak\}\$ is presented as a function of the black hole mass, AGN luminosity, and `coronal radius' of the \{{\textbackslash}sc optxagnf\} model upon which \{{\textbackslash}sc oxaf\} is based. We show that the soft X-ray excess does not significantly affect photoionization modeling predictions of strong emission lines in Seyfert narrow-line regions. Despite its simplicity, \{{\textbackslash}sc oxaf\} accounts for opacity effects where the accretion disk is ionized because it inherits the `color correction' of \{{\textbackslash}sc optxagnf\}.

	abstract = {The first billion years of the Universe is a pivotal time: stars, black holes (BHs) and galaxies form and assemble, sowing the seeds of galaxies as we know them today. Detecting, identifying and understand- ing the first galaxies and BHs is one of the current observational and theoretical challenges in galaxy formation. In this paper we present a population synthesis model aimed at galaxies, BHs and Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) at high redshift. The model builds a population based on empirical relations. Galaxies are characterized by a spectral energy distribution determined by age and metallicity, and AGNs by a spectral energy distribution determined by BH mass and accretion rate. We validate the model against observational constraints, and then predict properties of galaxies and AGN in other wavelength and/or luminosity ranges, estimating the contamination of stellar populations (normal stars and high-mass X-ray binaries) for AGN searches from the infrared to X-rays, and vice-versa for galaxy searches. For high-redshift galaxies, with stellar ages {\textless} 1 Gyr, we find that disentangling stellar and AGN emission is challenging at restframe UV/optical wavelengths, while high-mass X-ray binaries become more important sources of confusion in X-rays. We propose a color-color selection in JWST bands to separate AGN vs star-dominated galaxies in photometric observations. We also esti- mate the AGN contribution, with respect to massive, hot, metal-poor stars, at driving high ionization lines, such as C IV and He II. Finally, we test the influence of the minimum BH mass and occupa- tion fraction of BHs in low mass galaxies on the restframe UV/near-IR and X-ray AGN luminosity function.},

For a sub-sample of 200 radio-quiet quasars with black hole mass estimates and host galaxy corrections, we studied their mean SEDs as a function of a broad range of redshift, bolometric luminosity, black hole mass and Eddington ratio, and compared them with the Elvis et al. (1994, E94) type 1 AGN mean SED. We found that the mean SEDs in each bin are closely similar to each other, showing no statistical significant evidence of dependence on any of the analyzed parameters. We also measured the SED dispersion as a function of these four parameters, and found no significant dependencies. The dispersion of the XMM-COSMOS SEDs is generally larger than E94 SED dispersion in the ultraviolet, which might be due to the broader ``window function'' for COSMOS quasars, and their X-ray based selection.},

The infrared (IR) regime provides most of the information to characterize the dusty structures that bridge from the galaxy to the black hole, providing clues to the black hole growth and host galaxy evolution. Over the past several decades, with the commissioning of various ground, airborne and space IR observing facilities, our interpretations of the AGN circumnuclear structures have advanced significantly through improved understanding of how their dust emission changes as a function of wavelength and how the heating of the dusty structures responds to variations of the energy released from the central engine. In this review, we summarize the current observational knowledge of the AGN IR broad-band spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and the IR time variability behavior covering large ranges of AGN luminosity and redshift, and discuss some first-order insights into the obscuring structures and host galaxy IR properties that can be obtained by integrating the relevant observations into a coherent picture.},

	abstract = {Mid-infrared observations are powerful in identifying heavily obscured Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) which have weak emission in other wavelengths. Data from the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) onboard JWST provides an excellent opportunity to perform such studies. We take advantage of the MIRI imaging data from the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science Survey (CEERS) to investigate the AGN population in the distant universe. We estimate the source properties of MIRI-selected objects by utilizing spectral energy distribution (SED) modelling, and classify them into star-forming galaxies (SF), SF-AGN mixed objects, and AGN. The source numbers of these types are 418, 111, and 31, respectively, from 4 MIRI pointings covering \${\textbackslash}sim 9\$ arcmin\${\textasciicircum}2\$. The sample spans a redshift range of \${\textbackslash}approx 0\$--5. We derive the median SEDs for all three source types, respectively, and publicly release them. The median MIRI SED of AGN is similar to the typical SEDs of hot dust-obscured galaxies and Seyfert 2s, for which the mid-IR SEDs are dominantly from AGN-heated hot dust. Based on our SED-fit results, we estimate the black-hole accretion density (BHAD; i.e., total BH growth rate per comoving volume) as a function of redshift. At \$z{\textless}3\$, the resulting BHAD agrees with the X-ray measurements in general. At \$z{\textgreater}3\$, we identify a total of 27 AGN and SF-AGN mixed objects, leading to that our high-\$z\$ BHAD is substantially higher than the X-ray results (\${\textbackslash}sim 0.5\$ dex at \$z {\textbackslash}approx 3\$--5). This difference indicates MIRI can identify a large population of heavily obscured AGN missed by X-ray surveys at high redshifts.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12492},
	abstract = {Black holes with masses in excess of several billion solar masses have been found at redshifts 6-7.5, when the universe was less than 1 Gyr old. The existence of such supermassive black holes already in place at such early epochs has been challenging for theoretical models and distinguishing between different scenarios has prompted the search for their progenitors at earlier epochs. Here we present an extensive analysis of the JWST-NIRSpec spectrum (from the JADES survey) of GN-z11, an exceptionally luminous galaxy at z=10.6, revealing the detection of the high ionization [NeIV]\${\textbackslash}lambda\$2423 transition and semi-forbidden nebular lines tracing gas densities higher than \${\textbackslash}rm 10{\textasciicircum}\{10\}{\textasciitilde}cm{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\$, typical of the Broad Line Region of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). These spectral features indicate that, in addition to star formation, GN-z11 also hosts an accreting black hole. We do not exclude a contribution from extreme stellar populations, however Wolf Rayet stars alone cannot account for many of the spectral properties. The spectrum also reveals a deep and blueshifted CIV\${\textbackslash}lambda\$1549 absorption trough, tracing an outflow with a velocity of \${\textbackslash}sim 800-1000\$ km/s, higher than typically observed in starburst galaxies, hence likely driven by the AGN. Assuming local virial scaling relations, we derive a black hole mass of \${\textbackslash}rm {\textbackslash}log\{(M\_\{BH\}/M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\})\}=6.2{\textbackslash}pm 0.3\$, accreting at about 5 times the Eddington rate. While super-Eddington accretion is probably episodic, if it has been occurring for the previous \${\textbackslash}sim 100\$ Myr, then the black hole could have potentially originated even from a stellar mass seed at z\${\textbackslash}sim\$12-15. We finally discuss that our finding naturally explains the high luminosity of GN-z11 and can also provide an explanation for its exceptionally high nitrogen abundance.},

Its prominent broad components in several hydrogen and helium lines (while absent in the forbidden lines), and the detection of a large equivalent width of He II \${\textbackslash}lambda4686\$, EW(He II) \${\textbackslash}sim20\$ Angstrom, unambiguously identify it as an active galactic nucleus (AGN). We measure a gas-phase metallicity of \$Z\_\{{\textbackslash}rm gas\}/Z\_{\textbackslash}odot{\textbackslash}sim0.21{\textasciicircum}\{+0.08\}\_\{-0.04\}\$, lower than what has been inferred for both more luminous AGN at similar redshift and lower redshift AGN.

We detect broad H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ emission from both sources, with FWHM of \$2038{\textbackslash}pm286\$ and \$1807{\textbackslash}pm207\$ km s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$, resulting in black hole (BH) masses that are 1-2 dex below that of existing samples of luminous quasars at \$z{\textgreater}5\$. The first source, CEERS 1670 at \$z=5.242\$, is 2-3 dex fainter than known quasars at similar redshifts and was previously identified as a candidate low-luminosity AGN based on its rest-frame optical SED. We measure a BH mass of \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm BH\}=1.3{\textbackslash}pm0.4{\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{7\}{\textasciitilde}M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$, confirming that this AGN is powered by the least-massive BH known in the universe at the end of cosmic reionization. The second source, CEERS 3210 at \$z=5.624\$, is inferred to be a heavily obscured, broad-line AGN caught in a transition phase between a dust-obscured starburst and an unobscured quasar. We estimate its BH mass to be \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm BH\}{\textbackslash}simeq 0.9-4.7 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{7\}{\textasciitilde}M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$, depending on the level of dust obscuration assumed. We derive host stellar masses, \$M\_{\textbackslash}star\$, allowing us to place constraints on the BH-galaxy mass relationship in the lowest mass range yet probed in the early universe. The \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm BH\}/M\_{\textbackslash}star\$ ratio for CEERS 1670, in particular, is consistent with or higher than the empirical relationship seen in massive galaxies at \$z=0\$. We examine the emission-line ratios of both sources and find that their location on the BPT and OHNO diagrams is consistent with model predictions for low-metallicity AGN with \$Z/Z\_{\textbackslash}odot {\textbackslash}simeq 0.2-0.4\$. The spectroscopic identification of low-luminosity, broad-line AGN at \$z{\textgreater}5\$ with \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm BH\}{\textbackslash}simeq 10{\textasciicircum}\{7\}{\textasciitilde}M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ demonstrates the capability of JWST to push BH masses closer to the range predicted for the BH seed population and provides a unique opportunity to study the early stages of BH-galaxy assembly.},

The broad H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ line widths of \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{FWHM\}{\textbackslash}simeq1000-6000{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}mathrm\{km{\textbackslash} s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\}\$ suggest that the AGNs have low-mass black holes with \$M\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{BH\}{\textbackslash}sim10{\textasciicircum}6-10{\textasciicircum}7{\textbackslash} M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$, remarkably lower than those of low-luminosity quasars previously identified at \$z{\textgreater}4\$ with ground-based telescopes. JWST and HST high-resolution images reveal that the majority of them show extended morphologies indicating significant contribution to the total lights from their host galaxies, except for three compact objects two of which show red SEDs, probably in a transition phase from faint AGNs to low luminosity quasars. Careful AGN-host decomposition analyses show that their host's stellar masses are systematically lower than the local relation between the black hole mass and the stellar mass, implying a fast black hole growth consistent with predictions from theoretical simulations. A high fraction of the broad-line AGNs (\${\textbackslash}sim5{\textbackslash}\%\$), higher than \$z{\textbackslash}sim0\$, indicates that a number density of such faint AGNs is higher than an extrapolation of the quasar luminosity function, implying a large population of AGNs including type 1 and type 2 in the early universe. Such faint AGNs contribute to cosmic reionization, while the total contribution is not large, up to \${\textbackslash}sim50{\textbackslash}\%\$ at \$z{\textbackslash}sim6\$, because of their faint nature.},

	abstract = {We report the discovery of an accreting supermassive black hole at z=8.679, in CEERS\_1019, a galaxy previously discovered via a Ly\${\textbackslash}alpha\$-break by Hubble and with a Ly\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ redshift from Keck. As part of the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science (CEERS) survey, we observed this source with JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy, MIRI and NIRCam imaging, and NIRCam/WFSS slitless spectroscopy. The NIRSpec spectra uncover many emission lines, and the strong [O III] emission line confirms the ground-based Ly\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ redshift. We detect a significant broad (FWHM{\textasciitilde}1200 km/s) component in the H\${\textbackslash}beta\$ emission line, which we conclude originates in the broad-line region of an active galactic nucleus (AGN), as the lack of a broad component in the forbidden lines rejects an outflow origin. This hypothesis is supported by the presence of high-ionization lines, as well as a spatial point-source component embedded within a smoother surface brightness profile. The mass of the black hole is log(\$M\_\{BH\}/M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\})=6.95\{{\textbackslash}pm\}0.37\$, and we estimate that it is accreting at 1.2 (\${\textbackslash}pm\$0.5) x the Eddington limit. The 1-8 \${\textbackslash}mu\$m photometric spectral energy distribution (SED) from NIRCam and MIRI shows a continuum dominated by starlight and constrains the host galaxy to be massive (log M/M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\${\textasciitilde}9.5) and highly star-forming (SFR{\textasciitilde}30 M\$\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ yr\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$). Ratios of the strong emission lines show that the gas in this galaxy is metal-poor (Z/Z\$\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\${\textasciitilde}0.1), dense (n\$\_\{e\}\${\textasciitilde}10\${\textasciicircum}\{3\}\$ cm\${\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\$), and highly ionized (log U{\textasciitilde}-2.1), consistent with the general galaxy population observed with JWST at high redshifts. We use this presently highest-redshift AGN discovery to place constraints on black hole seeding models and find that a combination of either super-Eddington accretion from stellar seeds or Eddington accretion from massive black hole seeds is required to form this object by the observed epoch.},

	abstract = {We report a candidate of a low-luminosity active galactic nucleus (AGN) at z=5 that was selected from the first near-infrared images of the JWST CEERS project. This source, named CEERS-AGN-z5-1 at absolute 1450 A magnitude M1450=-19.5 +/- 0.3, was found via a visual selection of compact sources from a catalog of Lyman break galaxies at z{\textgreater}4, taking advantage of the superb spatial resolution of the JWST/NIRCam images. The 20 photometric data available from CFHT, HST, Spitzer, and JWST suggest that the continuum shape of this source is reminiscent of that for an unobscured AGN, and there is a clear color excess in the filters where the redshifted Hbeta+[OIII] and Halpha are covered. The estimated line luminosity is L\_Hbeta+[OIII] =10{\textasciicircum}43.0 erg s-1 and L\_Halpha =10{\textasciicircum}42.9 erg s-1 with the corresponding rest-frame equivalent width EW\_\{Hbeta+[OIII]\} =1100 A and EW\_Halpha =1600 A, respectively. Our SED fitting analysis favors the scenario that this object is either a strong broad-line emitter or even a super-Eddington accreting black hole (BH), although a possibility of an extremely young galaxy with moderate dust attenuation is not completely ruled out. The bolometric luminosity, L\_bol=2.5 +/- 0.3 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}44 erg s-1, is consistent with those of z{\textless}0.35 broad-line AGNs with M\_BH = 10{\textasciicircum}6 M\_sun accreting at the Eddington limit. This new AGN population at the first 1.1 billion years of the universe may close the gap between the observed BH mass range at high redshift and that of BH seeds. Spectroscopic confirmation is awaited to secure the redshift and its AGN nature.},
